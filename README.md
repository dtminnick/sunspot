## Introduction

## Dataset

This project provides, in a single dataset, sunspot data published on NASA's Solar 
Physics website and compiled by Dr. David Hathaway, a retired member of the MSFC 
solar physics group and NASA's Ames Research Center in California.

The dataset is created from ASCII text files containing records for individual
years of sunspot observations. Each file consists of records with information
on individual sunspot groups for each day that spots were observed.

The Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO) compiled sunspot observations from a small
network of observatories to produce a dataset of daily observations starting in
May of 1874. The observatory concluded this dataset in 1976 after the US Air
Force (USAF) started compiling data from its own Solar Optical Observing Network
(SOON). This work was continued with the help of the US National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) with much of the same information being
compiled through to the present.
